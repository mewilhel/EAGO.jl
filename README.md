## EAGO's Optimizer Capabilities

EAGO is a deterministic global optimizer designed to address a wide variety of optimization problems, emphasizing nonlinear programs (NLPs), by propagating McCormick relaxations along the factorable structure of each expression in the NLP. Most operators supported by modern automatic differentiation (AD) packages (e.g. **+**, **sin**, **cosh**) are supported by EAGO and a number utilities for sanitizing native Julia code and generating relaxations on a wide variety of user-defined functions have been included. Currently, EAGO supports problems that have a priori variable bounds defined and have differentiable constraints. That is, problems should be specified in the generic form below:

## EAGO's Relaxations

For each nonlinear term, EAGO makes use of factorable representations to construct bounds and relaxations. In the case of F = y(y-5)sin(y), a list is generated and rules for constructing McCormick relaxations are used to formulate relaxations in the original Y decision space<sup>1</sup>:

- *v*<sub>1</sub> = y
- *v*<sub>2</sub> = *v*<sub>1</sub> - 5
- *v*<sub>3</sub> = sin(*v*<sub>1</sub>)
- *v*<sub>4</sub> = *v*<sub>1</sub>*v*<sub>2</sub>
- *v*<sub>5</sub> = *v*<sub>4</sub>*v*<sub>3</sub>
- F = *v*<sub>5</sub>

<img src="https://github.com/PSORLab/EAGO.jl/blob/master/docs/src/McCormick/Figure_1.png" width="60%" height="60%">

Either these original relaxations, differentiable McCormick relaxations<sup>2</sup>, or affine relaxations thereof can be used to construct relaxations of optimization problems useful in branch and bound routines for global optimization. Utilities are included to combine these with algorithms for relaxing implicit functions<sup>3</sup> and forward-reverse propagation of McCormick arithmetic<sup>4</sup>.

## Sample Usage

EAGO makes use of the JuMP algebraic modeling language to improve the user's experience in setting up optimization models. Consider the familiar "process" problem instance<sup>5</sup>:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/PSORLab/EAGO.jl/blob/master/images/ProcessFormulation.svg" width="60%" height="60%">


This model can be formulated using JuMP code as:

```julia
using JuMP, EAGO

m = Model(EAGO.Optimizer)

# Define bounded variables
xL = [10.0; 0.0; 0.0; 0.0; 0.0; 85.0; 90.0; 3.0; 1.2; 145.0]
xU = [2000.0; 16000.0; 120.0; 5000.0; 2000.0; 93.0; 95.0; 12.0; 4.0; 162.0]
@variable(m, xL[i] <= x[i=1:10] <= xU[i])

# Define nonlinear constraints
@NLconstraint(m, e1, -x[1]*(1.12+0.13167*x[8]-0.00667* (x[8])^2)+x[4] == 0.0)
@NLconstraint(m, e3, -0.001*x[4]*x[9]*x[6]/(98-x[6])+x[3] == 0.0)
@NLconstraint(m, e4, -(1.098*x[8]-0.038* (x[8])^2)-0.325*x[6]+x[7] == 57.425)
@NLconstraint(m, e5, -(x[2]+x[5])/x[1]+x[8] == 0.0)

# Define linear constraints
@constraint(m, e2, -x[1]+1.22*x[4]-x[5] == 0.0)
@constraint(m, e6, x[9]+0.222*x[10] == 35.82)
@constraint(m, e7, -3*x[7]+x[10] == -133.0)

# Define nonlinear objective
@NLobjective(m, Max, 0.063*x[4]*x[7] - 5.04*x[1] - 0.035*x[2] - 10*x[3] - 3.36*x[5])

# Solve the optimization problem
JuMP.optimize!(m)
```

\begin{align}
\max_{x \in X}{0.063x_4x_7 - 5.04x_1 - 0.035x_2 - 10x_3 - 3.36x_2} & \\

Special handling has been included for linear/quadratic functions defined using the `@constraint` macro in JuMP and these can generally be expected to perform better than specifying quadratic or linear terms with the `@NLconstraint` macro.

## A Cautionary Note on Global Optimization

As a global optimization platform, EAGO's solvers can be used to find solutions of general nonconvex problems with a guaranteed certificate of optimality. However, global solvers suffer from the curse of dimensionality and therefore their performance is outstripped by convex/local solvers. For users interested in large-scale applications, be warned that problems generally larger than a few variables may prove challenging for certain types of global optimization problems.

## Package Capabilities

The EAGO package has numerous features: a solver accessible from JuMP/MathOptInterface, domain reduction routines, McCormick relaxations, and specialized non-convex semi-infinite program solvers. A full description of all EAGO features is available in the [**documentation website**](https://psorlab.github.io/EAGO.jl/dev/). A series of example have been provided in the form of Jupyter notebooks in the separate [**EAGO-notebooks**](https://github.com/PSORLab/EAGO-notebooks) repository.

## Recent News

  - Add supports psuedocost and reliability-based branching.
  - Add support for zero-one and integer variables.
  - Add support for conic and semi-definite constraints.
  - Add milp, conic, sdp, and convex-minlp subsolvers (default are GLPK, Hypatia, Hypatia, and Pavito).
  - Use MathOptInterface.Test in continuous integration testing.
  - Use MINLPTests in continuous integration testing.
  - Detects linear, mixed-integer, conic, and semi-definite input problems and
    passes these directly to the subsolver.

    fixed to Float64)
  - Use ntuples for storing bounds associated with each node. NodeBB -> NodeBB{N,T}.
  - Place GlobalOptimizer into subfield and remake it after parsing to reduce
    type instability.

## Installing EAGO

EAGO is a registered Julia package and it can be installed using the Julia package manager.
From the Julia REPL, type ] to enter the Pkg REPL mode and run the following command

```julia
pkg> add EAGO
```

Currently, EAGO is tied to a 0.19+ or greater version of JuMP. This allows a replication
of some of the internal features shared by EAGO and JuMP's AD scheme aka
generation of Wergert Tapes pass evaluators between JuMP and EAGO etc.

```julia
pkg> add JuMP
```

EAGO v0.6.0 is the current tagged version and requires Julia 1.2+ for full functionality (however Julia 1.0+ versions support partial functionality). Use with version 1.5 is recommended as the majority of in-house testing has occurred using this version of Julia. The user is directed to the [**High-Performance Configuration**](https://psorlab.github.io/EAGO.jl/Optimizer/high_performance/)
for instructions on how to install a high performance version of EAGO (rather than the basic entirely open-source version).
If any issues are encountered when loading EAGO (or when using it), please submit an issue using the Github [**issue tracker**](https://github.com/PSORLab/EAGO.jl/issues).

## Bug reporting, support and feature requests

Please report bugs or feature requests by opening an issue using the Github [**issue tracker**](https://github.com/PSORLab/EAGO.jl/issues). All manners of feedback are encouraged.

## Current limitations
- Nonlinear handling assumes that box-constraints of nonlinear terms are available or can be inferred from bounds-tightening.
- Only currently supports continuous functions. Support for mixed-integer problems is forthcoming.

## Work In Progress
- Extensions for nonconvex dynamic global & robust optimization.
- Provide support for mixed-integer problems.
- Update EAGO to support nonsmooth problems (requires: a nonsmooth local nlp optimizer or lexiographic AD, support for relaxations is already included).
- Performance assessment of nonlinear (differentiable) relaxations and incorporation into main EAGO routine.
- Evaluation and incorporation of implicit relaxation routines in basic solver.
