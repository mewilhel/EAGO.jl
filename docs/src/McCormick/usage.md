# Basic Usage

## **Bounding a function via McCormick operators**
In order to bound a function using a McCormick relaxation. You first construct
structure that bounds the input variables then you construct pass these variables
two a function.

In the example below, convex/concave relaxations of the function `f(x) = sin(2x) + exp(x) - x`
are calculated at `x = 1` on the interval `[-2,3]`.

```julia
using EAGO, IntervalArithmetic

# create MC object for x = 2.0 on [1.0,3.0] for relaxing
# a function f(x) on the interval Intv

f(x) = x*(x-5.0)*sin(x)

x = 2.0                          # value of independent variable x
Intv = Interval(1.0,4.0)         # define interval to relax over

# create McCormick object
xMC = MC{1,NS}(x,Intv,1)

fMC = f(xMC)             # relax the function

cv = fMC.cv              # convex relaxation
cc = fMC.cc              # concave relaxation
cvgrad = fMC.cv_grad     # subgradient/gradient of convex relaxation
ccgrad = fMC.cc_grad     # subgradient/gradient of concave relaxation
Iv = fMC.Intv           # retrieve interval bounds of f(x) on Intv
```

The plotting the results we can easily generate visual the convex and concave
relaxations, interval bounds, and affine bounds constructed using the subgradient
at the middle of X.

If we instead use the constructor `xMC = MC{1,Diff}(x,Intv,1)` in the above code, and then re-plot we arrive at the below graph

This can readily be extended to multivariate functions as shown below

```julia

f(x) = max(x[1],x[2])

x = [2.0 1.0]                                    # values of independent variable x
Intv = [Interval(-4.0,5.0), Interval(-5.0,3.0)]  # define intervals to relax over

# create McCormick object
xMC = [MC{2,Diff}(x[i], Intv[i], i) for i=1:2)]

fMC = f(xMC)            # relax the function

cv = fMC.cv              # convex relaxation
cc = fMC.cc              # concave relaxation
cvgrad = fMC.cv_grad     # subgradient/gradient of convex relaxation
ccgrad = fMC.cc_grad     # subgradient/gradient of concave relaxation
Iv = fMC.Intv            # retrieve interval bounds of f(x) on Intv
```
